Hello, my name is Shane Kizito and I am a software programmer with experience in Nodejs, Reactjs, MongoDb, ExpressJs, GraphQl and Python. I have a strong interest in web development and enjoy working on both the front-end and back-end of web applications. In my spare time, I like to learn new programming languages and technologies.
